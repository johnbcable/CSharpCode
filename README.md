Repository of my code samples pairing with the text C# 8.0 and .NET Core 3.0

## Summary of chapters

### Chapter 1
Some initial background information on C# (HelloCS) and tips on how to set up your development environment.
Main editor is going to be Visual Studio Code. 
Recommended extensions to install are:

### Chapter 2
Going into more depth in basic language features:
- numbers, 
- variables, 
- null handling, 
- formatting, 
- arrays, 
- arguments (command line)

### Chapter 3
This chapter covers controlling flow and converting types with the following topics:
- Operating on variables
- Understanding selection and iteration statements
- Casting and converting between types
- Handling excepions incl. checking for overflow

### Chapter 4
This chapter is all about writing, debugging and testing functions. It covers the following topics:
- Writing functions
- Debugging, during development
- Logging, during runtime
- Unit testing (using xUnit.net)

It also introduces use of some of the recommended VS Code extensions - C# XML Documentation Comments, SharpPad etc

### Chapter 5 - Building Your Own Types With Object-Oriented Programming
This chapter introduces use of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques in C#. It covers the following topics:
- Intrdouction to OOP concepts
- Building class libraries
- Storing data with fields
- Writing and calling methods
- Controlling access with properties and indexers

This is quite a meaty chapter

### Chapter 6 - Implementing Interfaces and Inheriting Classes
This chapter is about deriving new types from existing ones using object-oriented programming (OOP). It covers the following topics:
- Setting up a class library and console application
- Simplifying methods
- Raising and handling events
- Implementing interfaces
- Making types more reusable with generics
- Managing memory with reference and value types
- Inheriting from classes
- Casting within inheritance hierarchies
- Inheriting and extending .NET types

Once again, this chapter covers quite a lot of MS-flavoured object-oriented programming (OOP).

### Chapter 7 - Understanding and Packaging .NET Types
This chapter is about how .NET Core implements the types that are defined in the .NET Standard. This chapter covers the following topics:
- Introducing .NET Core 3.0
- Understanding .NET Core components
- Publishing your aplications for deployment
- Decompiling assemblies
- Packaging your libraries for NuGet distribution
- Porting from .NET Framework to .NET Core

### Chapter 8 - Working with Common .NET Types
This chapter is about some common .NET Standard types that are included with .NET Core. This chapter covers the following topics:
- Working with numbers
- Working with text
- Pattern matching with regular expressions
- Storing multiple objects in collections
- Working with spans, indexes and ranges
- Working with network resources
- Working with types and attributes
- Internationalizing your code

### Chapter 9 - Working with Files, Streams and Serialization
This chapter is about reading and writing to files and streams, text encoding and serialization. This chapter covers the following topics:
- Managing the file system
- Reading and writing with streams
- Encoding and decoding text
- Serializing object graphs
